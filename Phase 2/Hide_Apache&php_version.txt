Step of hiding Apache and php version (for Centos/RHEL 6/7 Vestacp apache, AWS EC2 t2.mirco)

Using "curl -I (Your domain)" to test

Before hiding:
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Date: Fri, 08 Apr 2022 14:45:48 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.52 () OpenSSL/1.0.2k-fips
Location: (Your domain)
Content-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Fri, 08 Apr 2022 14:45:48 GMT
Server: Apache
X-Powered-By: PHP/7.2.34
Upgrade: h2,h2c
Connection: Upgrade
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8


Hiding Apache version:

1. Modify the file
  nano /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf 
  OR 
  sudo vi /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
  
2. Search for ServerTokens and ServerSignature
  If the file has these 2 sections, uncomment it
  Need to be this -> 
  
  ServerTokens Prod
  ServerSignature Off
  
  Make sure these 2 line is not commented
  
  If you cannot find these 2 sections, just simply add these 2 line in the httpd.conf file.(Anywhere is ok)
  
3. Save the file

4. Restart Apache 
  sudo service httpd restart 
  OR
  sudo systemctl restart httpd
 

Hiding php version

1.(Optional) Find the php configuration. (Normally should be /etc/php.ini, just ensure the location of the configuration file)
  php -i | grep "Loaded Configuration File"

2. Modify the file 
  nano /etc/php.ini
  OR
  sudo vi /etc/php.ini

3. Change "expose_php = On" to "expose_php = Off"
  Hint: type / to find the keyword of expose, much faster
  
4. Save the file

5. Restart php-fpm 
  sudo service php-fpm restart
  
  
After hiding:
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Fri, 08 Apr 2022 15:40:53 GMT
Server: Apache
Upgrade: h2,h2c
Connection: Upgrade
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
